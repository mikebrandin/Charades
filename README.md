## How to play Charades

1. First, with a group of people (preferably on a conferencing software, but also playable in person) create a turn order of players and choose how many rounds you would like to play.
2. The player who's turn it is will confirm by inputting Y/y into the terminal and hitting enter. They will be presented with a randomly generated word (which is hidden from the other group members) they will have to try to act out in person without speaking. If someone guesses the word correctly within the 30 seconds allotted they are given a point along with the person who acted out the word.
3. Repeat Step 2 for each player and the given amount of rounds.
4. After the last round is finised, input X/x into the terminal and hit enter to end the game.
5. The person who has tallied the most points wins!
